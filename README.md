# Intel Internship – DSA Assignment

## Implemented Topics
1. Binary Search Tree (BST) Insertion
2. Red-Black Tree Insertion with Fix-Up

## Language Used
- C

## Files
- bst.c : BST insertion and inorder traversal
- red_black_tree.c : Red-Black Tree insertion with rotations

## Output
Inorder traversal is used to verify correctness.

## Notes
This assignment demonstrates understanding of basic DSA concepts such as trees, balancing, and rotations.

## Output

### Binary Search Tree (BST)
Input:
10, 5, 15, 3, 7

Output:
3 5 7 10 15

Inorder traversal confirms correct BST insertion.

---

### Red-Black Tree
Input:
10, 5, 15, 1, 6

Output:
1(R) 5(B) 6(R) 10(B) 15(B)

Sorted output confirms BST property, and node colors confirm Red-Black Tree balancing.
